The content on `src/flows/` is autogenerated. The generator code lives in `src/cli`. Make sure to modify the generator instead of modifying the code in `src/flows` unless the user specifically asks otherwise. If you suspect the user might want you to edit generated flow code yourself, ask first before editting it.
